Drunkscan

INSTALL

To build on POSIX-ish systems, try 

	cc -o drunkscan drunkscan.c

On VMS, something along the lines of

	CC drunkscan
	LINK drunkscan

should work. The following may be necessary to set up foreign command syntax in
DCL to allow command-line arguments to be passed:

	DEFINE DCL$PATH DISK$USERS:[USERS.<username>]


RATIONALE (aka, why do we need another portscanner?)

This was my first attempt at TCP sockets programming. It almost didn't get
written, since nmap pretty much revolutionalized the portscanner, and drunkscan
doesn't really bring anything new to the table. But I wanted to get some
practical experience with sockets, and I couldn't think of anything else to
write other than a netcat clone.

This was hacked out during a party back in summer of 2000 in Las Vegas, and
debugged the following morning. At the time, I only tested it on FreeBSD 3.x,
but it seems to compile and work just fine under NetBSD, OpenBSD, FreeBSD 9,
and Debian on i386 architecture, Gentoo on amd64, and VMS on Alpha or Itanium.
Prior to writing this, I'd been using Linux/i386, NetBSD/SPARC32, FreeBSD/i386,
and who knows what else to practice writing portable code. Apparently those
efforts paid off.

I had lost this code for nearly a decade, and finally got it back after a
year-and-a-half data recovery effort of a corrupt disk image from CHIBA, my old
personal Dell Inspiron Pentium II 233Mhz.
