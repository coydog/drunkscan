Drunkscan

This was my first attempt at TCP sockets programming. It almost didn't
get written, since nmap pretty much revolutionalized the portscanner,
and drunkscan doesn't really bring anything new to the table. But I 
wanted to get some practical experience with sockets, and I couldn't
think of anything else to write other than a netcat clone.

This was hacked out during a party back in summer of 2000 in Las Vegas, and
debugged the following morning. At the time, I only tested it on FreeBSD 3.x,
but it seems to compile and work just fine under NetBSD, OpenBSD, FreeBSD 9,
and Debian on i386 architecture.  Prior to writing this, I'd been using
Linux/i386, NetBSD/SPARC32, FreeBSD/i386, and who knows what else to practice
writing portable code. Apparently those efforts paid off.

I had lost this code for nearly a decade, and finally got it back after
a year-and-a-half data recovery effort of a corrupt disk image from 
CHIBA, my old personal Dell Inspiron Pentium II 233Mhz.
